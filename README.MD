## Django For APIs Code Examples

in this repo there are several Django Rest Framework ecamples from the book of the same name.

The following directories contain the actual projects: `library`, `todo`. These use the `pipenv` library to manage the dev environments, but you should be able to use them with just `Django` and `Django Rest Framework` as usual with just pip and python. The `todo` project also has a `react` front end project, it requires only `react` and `axios` dependencies to work, and should be enough to run `npm start` in the directory to work.
